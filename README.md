# CREAM


## What is it?
CREAM is an analytical framework for detecting co-regulated gene modules and performing subsequent analyses. This system contains three executable programs: ‘CREAM.jar’ is used to detect co-regulated gene modules from gene/protein expression data; and ‘CREAM_dcanalysis.jar’ and ‘CREAM_survival.jar’ are used to perform differential co-expression analysis and survival analysis on the resulting modules.
