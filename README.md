# CREAM


## What is it?
CREAM (Correlation-based Regulatory Events and Modules) is a multi-interaction network framework for gene expression analysis. It enables users to construct multi-interaction networks from gene expression data using desired interactions, identifying functional modules within these networks, and extracting prognostic subnetworks for specific clinical outcomes. This system contains two executable programs: ‘CREAM Module Detection.jar’ for network construction and module detection and ‘CREAM Survival Analysis.jar’ for prognostic subnetwork identification.


## Software requirements

- Java 1.5 or later must be installed.  [Download link](http://www.java.com)
- 1024 MB Java heap memory minimum.
- Operating systems: Platform independent

## Running

- Once Java is installed, to start CREAM in Microsoft Windows double click on ‘CREAM Module Detection.jar’ or ‘CREAM Survival Analysis.jar’.  
- Otherwise start CREAM from a command line while in the drem directory, enter the command: java -mx1024M -jar CREAM Module Detection.jar (or CREAM Survival Analysis.jar)
- If CREAM reports ‘Out of Memory Error’, the user can increase the -mx parameter.
- A detailed description can be found in 'User manual.pdf'.
